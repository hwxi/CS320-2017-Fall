A staircase has n steps. At every step you may choose to go up one
step or skip two steps and go up three steps. Write a tail-recursive
function that gives the number of ways you can walk up the staircase.
//
Note that you get only 5 points if your implementation is functionally
correct but not tail-recursive.
