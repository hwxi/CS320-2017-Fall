If you have not seen the 'Eyes' game, you can readily
find it on-line. For instance, here is a simple demo:

http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/academic/courses/CS320/Fall17/.xshare/cs320-2017-fall/assigns/assign09/Solution/Eyes/Eyes.html

What is required of you in this problem is to implement
a simplistic version of the game:

Each pupil should always move to the
position inside the eye containing it that is closest to
the current mouse pointer.

There may be bonus points for creativity of all sorts :)
