A demo of the Hanoi Towers puzzle can be seen at the
following link:

https://ats-lang.github.io/DOCUMENT/ATS2FUNCRASH/LECTURE/12-10/CODE/HanoiTowers.html

The control buttons are implemented in the standard callback
style. Please do some hacking to re-implement these buttons by
making use of event streams supported by Bacon.js.

Please feel free to make any changes to the given files as you
see fit. There is a Makefile for you to build the needed JS code.
