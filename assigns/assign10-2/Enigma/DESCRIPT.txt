This assignment asks you to give an implementation of the Enigma
machine.

You can implement either the Army version (3 rotors) or the Navy version
(5 rotors).

Try to use the provided Makefile to compile the code and see what it does.

This assignment is worth 50 points in total.

# A short note on Enigma
#
######

This is the fundamental mapping behind Enigma:

x -> p^(R^(f(R(p(x)))))

p (plugboard) is the inverse of itself
f (reflector) is the inverse of itself
R (rotor sequence) may not be the inverse of itself

p^ is the inverse of p, which equals p
R^ is the inverse of R, which may not equal R

Let r0 be a rotor.

Let r1 be r0 with its shift set to S. Then we have

r1(x) = r0(x) + S
r1^(x) = r0^(x - S)

where r0^ and r1^ are the inverse mappings of r0 and r1,
respectively.
